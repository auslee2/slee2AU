There is a pdf file called Project3-JavaAsteroids.pdf for original project description and guidlines.

project1.c and project2.c is part of Operating System, CPSC 4420. It this lastest project that I finished.
Instructions and guidlines are also attached as pdf file.

Math-cs application and Independent study on Radio decay
I coded in a relatively quick and easy style so that I could get the job done and focus primarily on research topic.
It may not contain full picture of research but it was my attempt to actually code out side of cs courses.

Since these project were not developed using git, I chose to them to one repository
